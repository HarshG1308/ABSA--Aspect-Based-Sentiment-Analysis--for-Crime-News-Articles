It is Modiâs guarantee,â he said to a cheering crowd. âFor the sake of vote-bank politics, TMC is putting Bengalâs identity at stake by encouraging and protecting illegal immigrants and that has become a threat to national security as well.An ecosystem has been created to support infiltrators,â Modi claimed, dovetailing barbs against Mamata Banerjeeâs âappeasement politicsâ with a new focus on âBengali prideâ.TMC anti-development: PM in BengalOther BJP politicians, like former MP Locket Chatterjee and assembly opposition leader Suvendu Adhikari started with the customary âJai Sri Ramâ slogan but the PMâs eschewing of Ram and his focus on Bengalâs deities and past political, cultural and industrial icons (like Bidhan Chandra Roy, Syama Prasad Mookerjee, Kadambini Ganguly, Dwarkanath Tagore and Bishnu Dey) gave a glimpse of BJPâs strategy in the run-up to the 2026 assembly poll: stress BJPâs connect with Bengal to offset TMCâs hammer-andtongs campaign against âthe harassment and torture of Bengalis in BJP-ruled statesâ.Modi also brought up âclassical language statusâ for Bengali, taking credit for âa BJP initiativeâ, while accusing Trinamool and Left Front of never caring for the language. Trinamool was âanti-developmentâ, Modi said, attributing the flight of Bengalâs youth to other states to that. âPeople across the country used to come here for employment.The trend has changed now. Existing industries are closing down. We have to pull Bengal out of this situation,â he said.The PM wove this narrative with BJPâs usual anti-Trinamool litany as he blamed its use of âsyndicate raj, gunda tax and mafia controlâ for driving out industries. âIt formulates policies encouraging corruption.Which industrialist will dare to come to a state where there are riots,â the Prime Minister asked.PM launches projects worth Rs 7,200 cr in poll-bound BiharMeanwhile, in Patna, PM laid foundation stones, inaugurated and dedicated to the nation multiple development projects worth over Rs 7,200 crore before addressing a public meeting during his Motihari programme.(With inputs from Madan Kumar in Patna)\nPM Modi\nPM Modi\nPM Modi\nPM Modi",

They are also likely to face trials elsewhere in the country.Kalyani additional sessions judge Suberthi Sarkar, who had convicted the nine on Thursday, sentenced them to life imprisonment under BNS 338, which involves forging of documents, and 10 other penal offences under both BNS and Information Technology Acts.Digital arrest is economic terrorism: Spl prosecutorThe defence indicated they would appeal against the conviction in the HC. IGP (CID) Akhilesh Chaturvedi said the nine cybercriminals were tripped by strong digital evidence.âProbe revealed the fraudsters were siphoning money through multiple bank accounts spread across different states. Police seized numerous passbooks, ATM cards, SIM cards and mobile phones during the operation.A detailed analysis of beneficiary accounts and phone numbers led us to uncover this sophisticated network,â the IGP said.During the five-month trial, 29 witnesses from four different states testified physically before the judge. They included SHO of Andheri (West) PS and branch managers of SBI, PNB, Canara Bank, Bandhan Bank, Federal Bank, and Ujjivan Small Finance Bank, from four states. The chargesheet ran into 2,600 pages. Special prosecutor Bivas Chatterjee said they highlighted the ordeal of other victims of the gang and stressed that such frauds amounted to economic terrorism.âWe told the judge how hard-earned money of two victims â one a retired professor and the other a retired state govt engineer â had been transferred outside the country. This was their lifeâs entire savings,â he told TOI.\nRepresentative photo\nRepresentative photo\nRepresentative photo\nRepresentative photo",

      "content": "NEW DELHI: Tensions escalated at Saket District Court on Saturday as a group of lawyers staged a protest against the Delhi Police over the registration of an FIR against advocates accused of assaulting a police sub-inspector.The Saket Bar Association has called for a strike and barred police personnel from entering the court premises.The protest follows an incident on Thursday, where a sub-inspector alleged that he was manhandled and had his uniform torn by a group of lawyers inside the court complex. The officer had gone to court for a hearing in connection with an ongoing case and later made a PCR call around 2.53 pm, claiming he was assaulted outside court number 508.In response to the FIR filed by the police, the Saket Court Bar Association on Friday issued a notice announcing that its members would abstain from work in protest. Security has since been tightened around the court, with senior police officials deployed to assess the situation.Saket Court Secretary Anil Basoya said, \"We don't want strikes, but we are doing this because we are facing injustice... Police has registered a false FIR against lawyers and we are protesting...Some people were conducting illegal activities near the residence of one of the lawyers, and when he went to the nearest police station to complain, the Sub Inspector denied registering the complaint and assaulted the lawyer instead.\"Basoya further added that the assault continued inside the court complex. \"The police never conduct any investigation on lawyers' complaints... If they fulfil our demand, we will stop the strike; otherwise, this will continue...We will not allow the policemen to enter the court premises or work here,\" he said.Speaking to PTI, Basoya reiterated the charge of police inaction. \"In any matter where a lawyer is the victim, the police refuse to register FIR. Senior officers also don't help, and we then have to approach the court. If the police act against lawyers, then we will also stand against them.\"The Delhi Police have confirmed that an FIR has been registered and a probe is underway to identify the individuals involved.",

      "title": "Pahalgam killers TRF a global terror outfit: US",
      "content": "File photoPakistan on Thursday suffered the humiliation of having its latest terror avatar,The Resistance Front(TRF), responsible for the Pahalgam massacre, being designated a Foreign Terrorist Organisation by the US state department.TRF was also termed a âSpecially Designated Global Terroristâ in concurrence with the US treasury department. In a statement, secretary of stateMarco Rubiocalled TRF, whose existence Islamabad denies, a âfront and proxyâ for Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT), a Pakistan-backed terror outfit responsible for numerous terror attacks in India, including the 26/11 Mumbai carnage that killed 159.In a separate notification published in the Federal Register, Rubio said based upon a review of the administrative record assembled in this matter, and in consultation with the attorney general and the treasury secretary, he has concluded that âthere is a sufficient factual basis to find that Lashkar-e-Taiba uses the additional aliases The Resistance Front; TRF; Kashmir Resistance Front; and Kashmir Resistanceâ.The linkage endorsed Indiaâs stand that LeT continues to re-invent itself in Pakistan under new names.India welcomes moveMEA: TRF ban timely, important, strong assertion of Indo-US tiesThe announcement by the US state department designating TRF a Foreign Terrorist Organisation not only strengthens India's case for a UN ban on TRF but also spotlights Pakistan-sponsored terrorism exactly when Islamabad is looking to corner India on the J&K issue, using its ongoing presidency of the Security Council (UNSC) to hold an open debate next week on unresolved disputes.External affairs minister S Jaishankar welcomed the development, calling it a strong affirmation of India-US counterterrorism cooperation and appreciating the role of his counterpart Marco Rubio and the State Department.Separately, the MEA said in a statement that this was a timely and important step as the TRF had been involved in numerous terror-related activities, including the Pahalgam terrorist attack for which it twice claimed responsibility.As a non-permanent member, Pakistan had earlier worked â with help from China â to dilute the UNSC condemnation of the attack.One of the things it insisted on was removal of the terror groupâs name from the statement. Since 2023 â well before the Pahalgam attack â India had been sharing information with the Monitoring Team of the UN's 1267 Sanctions Committee, pointing to the TRFâs role as a cover for Pakistan based UN-proscribed terror groups like LeT and Jaish-eMohammed (JeM), for an international ban on the group.The govt is hoping that the US designation will bolster the case for TRFâs listing by the 1267 committee, even though it will be subject to approval not just by China but also, for now, Pakistan, a non-permanent member of the UNSC till the end of next year.âIndia has consistently emphasized the need for global cooperation in the fight against terrorism and the dismantling of terror infrastructure. The designation of TRF is a timely and important step reflecting the deep cooperation between India and the United States on counterterrorism,â said the ministry.The US ban on TRF is also the first real show of intent by the US under the second Trump administration to pin Pakistan down on the issue of cross-border terrorism. It follows multiple conflicting signals from Trump himself who made repeated remarks after Indiaâ Operation Sindoor that seemed to equate India, which sees itself as the victim and not aggressor, with Pakistan.Trump, in fact, continues to maintain â much to the delight of Pakistan â that he mediated the India-Pakistan ceasefire, preventing a nuclear conflagration.âThese actions... demonstrate the Trump administrationâs commitment to protecting our national security interests, countering terrorism, and enforcing President Trumpâs call for justice for the Pahalgam attack,â Rubio said in a statement, even as Islamabad is angling for a US presidential visit on the margins of the Quad summit in India later this year.Pakistan reacted with its customary denials to the terror designations, insisting it is a âfrontline state against terrorismâ despite legions of terrorists from Osama bin Laden to Khalid Shaikh Mohammed sheltering there and its nationals conducting numerous terrorist attacks across the world, including in the US.âInvestigations into the Pahalgam incidentâ¦ are still inconclusive. Any linkage with LeT, a defunct organisation banned in Pakistan, belies ground realities,â Pakistanâs foreign ministry said.\nFile photo\nFile photo\nFile photo\nFile photo\nIndia welcomes move\nIndia welcomes move\nIndia welcomes move",

      "content": "ANI photoJAMMU: A special NIA court on Thursday framed charges against two men accused of aiding the perpetrators of the Dhangri massacre, in which terrorists had gunned down five people in the Rajouri village on Jan 1, 2023.The court observed that the allegations against the accused â Nisar Ahmed (alias Haji Nisar) and Mushtaq Hussain (alias Chacha) â were grave. There was sufficient material on record to show that the duo not only harboured the terrorists by providing them with food and shelter, but also acted as guides to the killers, helping them reach the hideout that they had constructed on directions of their Pakistan-basedLashkar-e-Taibahandlers â Saifullah (alias Sajid Jutt), Abu Qatal (alias Qatal Sindhi) and Mohd Qasim.âThey were in constant touch with terrorists for approximately three months and did not tell anybody about them despite getting many opportunities. They also utilized the services of a minor for their illegal activities,â special judge Sandeep Gandotra observed, noting that charges must be framed against the duo based on their prima facie involvement in the crime.The judge said the statements on record have been taken at their face value, the truth of which need not be judged at this stage.âEven a strong suspicion found on material before the court is sufficient to frame the charge,â he added. These special courts have the authority to frame charges against individuals based on the evidence presented by the NIA.Subsequently, charges were framed against both accused under relevant sections of the IPC, Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, and Juvenile Justice Act. In the presence of their counsels, they were asked via virtual mode whether they wanted to plead guilty.Both pleaded not guilty and sought trial.Around 7.15pm on Jan 1, 2023, armed terrorists barged into the houses of villagers in Dhangri and sprayed them with bullets. Four persons were killed on the spot and seven were seriously injured in the attack. One injured person later succumbed.Rajouri Police registered an FIR in this connection under relevant sections of the IPC, Arms Act and UAPA. Central govt later handed over the investigation to NIA, following which the agency re-registered the case.Nisar and Mushtaq were arrested on Aug 31, 2023, and lodged in Central Jail, Kot Bhalwal, Jammu, where they are still incarcerated.Exactly a year after the massacre, NIA on Jan 21, 2024, detained a juvenile for his involvement in the attack. The minor was taken into custody from an observation home in RS Pura, Jammu, where he had been sent in connection with another case registered at Gursai PS (Mendhar), Poonch.\nANI photo\nANI photo\nANI photo\nANI photo",

The other accused include Onkareshwar Properties and promoters/directors Satyanand Yajee & K S Virk, sources said.EDâs action part of political witch hunt: Vadraâs officeThe Rouse Avenue court in Delhi is yet to take cognisance of the ED chargesheet against Robert Vadra. This is the second chargesheet filed against the Gandhi family in less than three months.The ED had filed a chargesheet against Sonia and Rahul Gandhi on April 17 in the National Herald money laundering case.Reacting to the ED chargesheet, Vadraâs office said the âpresent proceedings are nothing more than an extension of the political witch hunt by the present govtâ, adding that he would defend and clear his name in court. âAs a law-abiding citizen, Vadra has always and will continue to extend his fullest cooperation to the authorities and he is confident that at the end of it all, he will be cleared of any wrongdoing,â the statement said.Vadra is facing multiple money laundering cases for several land deals he negotiated under the then Congress govts in Haryana and Rajasthan, and for alleged favours he had received from the then Congress govt in Haryana led by then CMBhupinder Singh Hooda. The Hooda-led Congress govt had allowed changes in land use from agricultural to commercial/residential for properties acquired by Vadra, leading to alleged windfall gains for him.Vadra is also facing a money laundering investigation in a case filed against fugitive arms dealer Sanjay Bhandari. He has been accused of allegedly acquiring properties through Bhandari in London and Dubai from the proceeds of crime from multiple defence deals.In the present case in which chargesheet has been filed, Vadra has been accused of purchasing 3.5 acres in Shikohpur village in Gurgaonâs Sector 83 through his Skylight Hospitality Pvt Ltd from Onkareshwar Properties Pvt Ltd on Feb 12, 2008, for Rs 7.5 crore.The then Congress govt in Haryana immediately gave him a commercial licence to develop the property over 2.7 acres. Four months later, the same land was sold to DLF for Rs 58 crore, making a profit of Rs 50 crore within months of purchasing it.EDâs money laundering probe is based on an FIR registered by Gurgaon police in 2018, alleging fraudulent transactions in the land deal. The ED on Wednesday attached 43 properties worth over Rs 37 crore associated with Vadra and his entities, including Skylight Hospitality Pvt Ltd.\nRobert Vadra (File photo/PTI)\nRobert Vadra (File photo/PTI)\nRobert Vadra (File photo/PTI)\nRobert Vadra (File photo/PTI)",

      "content": "The agency also searched a premise in Mumbai linked to the accusedNEW DELHI/BATHINDA: The Directorate of Enforcement (ED) on Friday conducted searches at 22 de-addiction centres across Punjab, including in Chandigarh, Barnala and Ludhiana, after its investigation revealed illegal sale of drugs by these centres.The agency also searched a premise in Mumbai linked to the accused.Dr Amit Bansal, who runs these 22 centres, is prime accused in the case, sources said. Bansal, against whom Punjab Police has registered multiple FIRs, is alleged to be engaged in illegal sale of drugs from his de-addiction centres.Privately-run drug de-addiction centres in Punjab are allowed to administer BNX (Buprenorphine/Naloxone) medicine to enrolled patients.These drugs are strictly meant for rehabilitation of addicts. Taken in excess, it is considered drug abuse.âIt was found that Bansal, through his de-addiction centres, misused his facility and was allegedly involved in illegal sale of these drugs,â sources said.The agency has also been investigating drug inspector Rupinder Kaur, who allegedly assisted Bansal in providing incorrect inspection reports related to pilferage of medicine from his hospitals.Kaurâs premises were also searched, besides a pharmaceutical company manufacturing BNX.Bansal was, until some time ago, a major player in the de-addiction and rehabilitation business in Punjab.A native of Barnala town, around 175km from Chandigarh, he started his career by setting up a small-time scan centre and then established his first de-addiction centre under the name âManorog Kendraâ in Barnala.Bansal first ran into trouble in 2022 when two employees of his Ludhiana centre were arrested during a Vigilance Bureau raid for deficiencies in Buprenorphine and Naloxone.Authorities had then recovered 4,000 Buprenorphine tablets from a Honda Activa registered in the centreâs name. A case was registered in Mohali on Oct 5, 2022, but charges under NDPS Act were not added. Bansal was arrested in Mohali on Dec 31, after which all 22 centres came under scrutiny.

The father-son duo stays in the same house, while Baghel also has an MLA residence in Raipur. When ED carried out searches, Baghel was at his Raipur residence and was proceeding to Vidhan Sabha.The timing of the raid, on the last day of the assembly session, triggered sharp political reactions, particularly from the opposition Congress.Bid to suppress debate on tree-felling: CongressEDâs early-morning raid and the subsequent arrest of former Chhattisgarh CM Bhupesh Baghelâs son Chaitanya set off sharp reactions, with Congress alleging that the move was designed to suppress discussion on deforestation in Tamnar region of Raigarh district linked to a particular industrialist.ED had earlier searched Chaitanya Baghelâs premises on March 10 while probing some transactions allegedly linking him and his entities to âproceeds of crimeâ in the liquor âscamâ case.The agency did not disclose details of the charges against Chaitanya, but in an earlier press note, it had claimed that some senior bureaucrat, having protection of âtop executive of the stateâ, carried out the scam.Reacting to the arrest, Baghel Senior said the Centre was misusing its agencies to target opposition netas. âTo please their master PM Modi and Amit Shah, they have sent ED to my house. We wonât be scared or bow down,â he said.He, however, said he would cooperate with the probe.In this case, ED had in Jan arrested former excise minister Kawasi Lakhma; Anwar Dhebar, brother of Raipur mayor and Congressâs Aijaz Dhebar; and senior babus, including IAS officer Anil Tuteja and a telecom service officer, Arunpati Tripathi.After the arrest of Lakhma, ED had claimed that he was âaware of the complete affairs of the liquor scam, yet he did nothing to stop itâ.The agency has accused Lakhma of receiving Rs 2 crore every month from the syndicate involved in illegal liquor trade.ED had also said Lakhma played an important role in policy change, which led to the introduction of FL-10A licence in Chhattisgarh. âHe was an integral part of the syndicate and assisted it by manoeuvring the process and procedures as per their direction,â it said. The agency has so far attached assets worth over Rs 200 crore in the case.Baghel later said, âThe adjournment motion moved by Congress in the Chhattisgarh assembly over tree felling being carried out by Adani Group in Tamnar was disallowed by Speaker Raman Singh. The opposition alleged that there has been no adherence to the PESA Act, no compliance with directives issued by the National Green Tribunal, and even the resolution unanimously passed by the state assembly has been disregarded.Not even a discussion was permitted.âBringing an adjournment motion in the assembly, leader of the opposition Charandas Mahant and Baghel alleged in their speeches that âTamnar coal mine, which has been allotted to Maharashtra State Power Generation Company with its mine operator and developer being Adani, is being run solely for the benefit of a single industrialist, while local residents are being harassed and displacedâ.\nPTI photo\nPTI photo\nPTI photo\nPTI photo",

      "title": "Why are Edlow and Vaughan calling OPT illegal? Hereâs the real story",
      "content": "OPT faces mounting legal and political attacks, putting the future of 200,000 international graduates at risk.In the quietly panicked corridors of international education policy, a storm is gathering around the United Statesâ Optional Practical Training (OPT) programâand for once, itâs not hyperbole to say that the damage may already be done.The numbers are stark, the policy narrative even starker. According to the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcementâs (ICE) SEVIS 2024 report, over 194,554 international students received work authorisation under OPT last year. Of these, a staggering 95,384 secured extensions under the STEM OPT provision. And standing at the centre of this tectonic shift are Indian students, who account for nearly 98,000 of those OPT authorisations during the 2023â24 cycle, as confirmed by the Indian Ministry of External Affairs.But now, the very scaffolding of this bridgeâfrom academic promise to professional footholdâis under coordinated assault by voices both influential and ideological. Leading the charge are Jessica Vaughan, Director of Policy Studies at the Center for Immigration Studies (CIS), and Joseph Edlow, the newly confirmed Director of the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS). Both have testified before Congress in 2025 that OPT is not only legally suspect but structurally dangerous.The rhetoric may be wrapped in legalese, but the intent is clear: Dismantle the post-study work rights that have long made U.S. degrees a prized aspiration for internationalâand particularly Indianâstudents. Whatâs at stake is more than immigration. It is the erasure of a pipeline that has quietly underwritten Americaâs dominance in global tech and innovation.EdlowandVaughanâs case against OPT: Congress didn't sign it, so let's burn itAt the core of the campaign to dismantle the Optional Practical Training (OPT) program lies a foundational disputeânot merely about visas or foreign labour, but about who gets to define the boundaries of lawful work in postsecondary America.And in this ideological contest, Jessica Vaughan and Joseph Edlow have emerged as the architects of what they frame as a long-overdue correction.Their argument is deceptively simple: OPT is not lawâit is regulation. Worse, they claim, it is unregulated regulation, sustained not by statute but by administrative inertia and legal loopholes.In her detailed testimony before the House Judiciary Subcommittee in June 2025, VaughanâDirector of Policy Studies at the Center for Immigration Studies (CIS)âdelivered a withering critique of what she called âthe largest unregulated guest worker scheme in the United States.âDrawing from internal data sets provided by ICE and the Department of Homeland Security, Vaughan revealed that over 540,000 work authorisations were granted under OPT and CPT (Curricular Practical Training) in FY2023 alone.This, she argued, was not just administrative generosityâit was regulatory anarchy.In her words, OPT had \"spawned an industry of diploma mills, fake schools, bogus training programs, and illegal employment.\"According to her testimony, the Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP)âthe body meant to oversee the legitimacy of these academic affiliationsâwas too chronically under-resourced to vet the scale of demand. The result, she concluded, was a parallel ecosystem of academic storefronts and training programmes designed not for learning, but for visa preservation and labour substitution.But perhaps her sharpest critique was constitutional in tone.OPT, she reminded the Committee, is not authorised by the US Congress. It was created as an extension of executive rulemaking, first formalised under the Bush administration and later expanded under Obama. âThere has never been a vote in Congress,â Vaughan noted, âto allow hundreds of thousands of foreign graduates to work on US soil under this program.âEdlow, a former Trump-era official brought back to restore âlegal fidelityâ to immigration enforcement, seconded the legalistic rebuke.In multiple briefings before the Senate and in internal USCIS memoranda from AprilâJune 2025, Edlow contended that the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) makes no provision for post-completion work for F-1 visa holders. \"The INA is unambiguous,\" he said. \"Student visas are for studyânot for work after graduation.\"He took particular aim at the 2023 D.C. Circuit Court ruling, which upheld the legality of OPT and its STEM extension.The decision, Edlow claimed, rested on an âerroneous reading of statutory intentââone that unjustifiably enlarged the executive branch's power to define immigration eligibility criteria without congressional consent.In his congressional appearances and in internal DHS documents, Edlow has further proposed reorienting USCIS enforcement priorities. Specifically, he has called for an expanded role for the Fraud Detection and National Security (FDNS) directorate in vetting OPT applicants and employersâa move that signals a coming compliance-heavy era, where student employment records could be re-audited, revoked, or flagged for deportation if found wanting.Both Vaughan and Edlow converge on the same policy prescription, stated either in soft legalism or hard numbers: The OPT program must either be terminated outright or restricted so severely that it becomes operationally nonviable for most international graduates. In other words, OPT must be stripped of its current utility to ensure it cannot continue under the guise of administrative legitimacy.What really lies beneath Edlow and Vaughanâs constitutional and legal arguments?Behind Edlow and Vaughanâs polished legal rhetoric lies a deeper missionâone that has less to do with statutes and more to do with reshaping Americaâs relationship with global talent.Woven beneath the testimony is a broader, more ideological belief that international student mobility has been hijacked by corporate interests, and that foreign graduates are now indistinguishable from guest workers, hired to circumvent wage floors, sidestep payroll taxes, and bypass labour market tests that would otherwise favour American graduates.To this end, Vaughan and Edlowâs critique is not merely of OPT as policy, but of OPT as economic architectureâan invisible scaffold that supports tech giants, universities, and global talent mobility.For them, removing that scaffold is not disruption. It is restoration.Come, pay, tuition and leaveWhat Edlow and Vaughan propose is more than a policy fixâit is a structural decoupling of education from employability, one that threatens to return the F-1 visa to a narrow, transactional instrument: come, pay tuition, and leave.It is this return to pre-globalisation thinking that most alarms educators and economists alike. And it is this version of âlegal clarityâ that could leave hundreds of thousands of studentsâincluding the 98,000 Indian graduates currently working under OPTâon the edge of a bureaucratic cliff, with no safety net beyond the 90-day unemployment cap.TOI Education is on WhatsApp now.

      "content": "Elon Musk (File photo)NEW DELHI: The Centre told Karnataka high court Thursday that allowing the proliferation of unlawful content on social media in the name of free speech endangered democracy, and accused Elon Musk-owned X of attempting to escape accountability by taking shelter under the IT Actâs âsafe harbourâ protection.Questioning the US-based companyâs locus standi to move an Indian HC for protection of fundamental rights, solicitor general Tushar Mehta said the constitutional protection to freedom of speech under Article 19(1)(a) must not be misunderstood as absolute protection for unlawful content.âConstitutional jurisprudence clearly differentiates between protected speech that contributes meaningfully to democratic discourse and unlawful speech that undermines societal stability and individual rights,â it said.âSafe harbourâ not an absolute right, but a privilege contingent upon strict adherence to statutory duties: GovtIt said the âsafe harbourâ provision, which protects social media platforms from liability for content posed by their users, was a privilege available only to those internet intermediaries which were responsible.X had moved HC seeking to restrain govt departments from taking coercive action against it and its officials for the content on the microblogging site and said, âUnlawful and unjustified orders harm the X platform and its ability to operate.The issuance of information blocking orders without following due process of law, and in violation of IT Act and the Constitution, violates Xâs right to equality under Article 14 and detrimentally impacts its business.âIn written submissions before HC, solicitor general Tushar Mehta said, âProliferation of what can be termed as unlawful content on social media platforms poses an unprecedented threat to public discourse, democracy and societal stability.ââSocial media intermediaries possess an unparalleled ability to amplify information instantaneously, without traditional barriers like language or geographical limitations, and thus carry significant responsibilities,â the law officer said.Advent of the internet, social media and digital intermediaries had fundamentally altered the character and scale of human communication, demanding a re-examination and suitable tailoring of constitutional standards, Mehta said, adding Indiaâs internet subscriber base had grown from 25 crore in 2013-14 to 97 crore in Sept 2024.The govtâs stand that âsafe harbourâ does not mean blanket immunity can have implications for all social media platforms. This also rhymes with the growing call for repeal of Section 230 of US's Communications Decency Act from which social media giants derive the immunity.The Centre said âsafe harbourâ protection for internet intermediaries was not an unconditional entitlement but a privilege contingent upon strict adherence to statutory duties.While committing to full protection of the right to free speech, the govt said, âThe question raised by X cannot be examined merely from the prism of the person using this medium.âThe concept of âsafe harbourâ inherently includes rigorous responsibilities, requiring intermediaries to promptly and effectively remove or disable unlawful content upon receiving notice. These safeguards are deliberately designed to balance innovation with accountability, ensuring intermediaries do not become platforms for unlawful activities.âThe govt said Xâs attempt was to present âsafe harbourâ as an absolute right, devoid of any corresponding duties. âSuch a stand fundamentally misconstrues the very basis of this legal protection. âSafe harbourâ is not a constitutional guarantee but a statutory privilege, specifically designed to foster responsible conduct,â it said.It told HC that X had confused itself with the play of Sections 69A and 79 of the IT Act.It said Section 69A pertains explicitly to govt orders for blocking content with serious penal consequences for non-compliance whereas Section 79 deals with due diligence obligations to maintain âsafe harbourâ protection.The Centre said X purposefully blurred the clear distinction to escape accountability for its statutory duties. It said social media platforms use âamplificationâ mechanisms to push visibility of a particular type of view.âThe algorithms used by intermediaries actively curate and boost content, shaping public opinion and significantly influencing social harmony or disorder. This active role demands heightened accountability, necessitating robust regulation specifically tailored for social media, distinct from traditional media,â the Centre further said.\nElon Musk (File photo)\nElon Musk (File photo)\nElon Musk (File photo)\nElon Musk (File photo)",

      "content": "Supreme CourtNEW DELHI: The Supreme Court rescued a young man, who impulsively eloped with a college girl and stayed together at Hyderabad for two months but for the next 13 years the man faced the rigour of police investigation and later, was concurrently convicted of kidnapping and rape by the trial court and the Telangana HC.A bench of Justices Sanjay Karol and Sandeep Mehta acquitted the man of all charges on finding that the couple were in a consensual relationship and had eloped on their own volition. The trial court had convicted and sentenced him to seven years rigorous imprisonment, which was reduced to two years by the HC.The man had eloped with his friendâs sister on Aug 4, 2012, and the couple stayed at Shadnagar, Hyderabad. The girlâs mother had on Aug 8 lodged a missing complaint with police.On Oct 12, the man met with an accident while riding his motorcycle and was admitted to hospital. On that day the girl returned to her parental home. On her statement, the police lodged an FIR for kidnapping and rape against the man.Analysing the evidence produced before the trial court, the bench said, âThe girlâs deposition does not demonstrate that the man forcibly removed or enticed her from the guardianship of her parents with deceit or inducement.She admits having voluntarily accompanied the man on a motorbike on Aug 4, 2012. SC wondered as to why the girlâs mother waited for four days to lodge a missing complaint and said the girl living willingly and without protest with the man for two months generates doubts over the kidnapping theory of the police.The bench said when the man was hospitalised after the accident, she remained with him for two days. On rape charge, it said, âThis charge has no legs to stand on, for she only makes a positive statement about the occurrence of sexual intercourse and does not even in the slightest imply the same to be against her will.âAcquitting him of all charges, Justices Karol and Mehta said, âWe do not find any evidence which may suggest that the appellant kidnapped the victim from lawful guardianship or confined her, for approximately two months, against her volition in a house at Hyderabad or had sexual intercourse with the victim against her will or without her consent.â\nSupreme Court\nSupreme Court\nSupreme Court\nSupreme Court",

      "content": "Calcutta high courtKOLKATA: Three persons awarded death sentence for a murder and incarcerated for the past 11 years were acquitted on Thursday by Calcutta high court, which ruled that the prosecution had failed to conclusively establish their hand in the killing of a 28-year-old woman, whose mutilated body was found at Sealdah railway station in 2014.A division bench of justices Debangsu Basak and Md Shabbar Rashidi held that there was no evidence whatsoever to associate the three accused â the womanâs husband and two others â with the murder.No proof that any of 3 accused was near crime spot: HCTheir presence at the scene of crime at the relevant time has not been proved convincingly, Calcutta HC held. On the morning of May 20, 2014, chopped body parts of Jayanti Deb were found in the parking area of Sealdah station, some wrapped in a quilt and some stuffed into a trolley bag.Investigating the case, Govt Railway Police arrested her estranged husband Surojit Deb, his girlfriend Lipika Poddar and one Sanjoy Biswas.Surojit and Lipika were accused of committing the murder and hiring Sanjoy to dispose of the body.Charges were framed against the three on April 21, 2015. In 2019, a Sealdah court found them guilty of murder, destruction of evidence and criminal conspiracy, and sentenced them to death.The high court bench overturned the verdict. The HC observed that there was âoverwhelming evidenceâ that Surojit had moved out of his marital home with his daughter much before the crime, and was living elsewhere with Lipika. There was absolutely no evidence that any of the three accused was in the vicinity of the crime spot around the date of the incident, the court said, acquitting all three. âThe prosecution had hopelessly failed to bring home the charges levelled against the appellants at the trial, beyond all reasonable doubts sufficient enough to secure their conviction,â the bench stated.The trial court order was based on Sanjoyâs âconfessionâ, which he later retracted.\nCalcutta high court\nCalcutta high court\nCalcutta high court\nCalcutta high court",

      "title": "Natal family violence against women remains largely underreported: Study",
      "publication_date": "2025-07-20T00:08:32+05:30",
      "content": "A study conducted by a Kolkata-based feminist organisation has found that natal family violence against women is widely underreported. The organisation and its researchers have asked for stricter laws to include natal family violence under the domestic violence laws and sought a wider study into the matter to understand the gravity of this violence in India.\nSwayam, a feminist organisation which has worked across seven districts of West Bengal for the past half a decade worked with over 50 survivors of natal family violence and found that 75% of the women faced verbal and emotional abuse, and 68% faced physical abuse, and 20% faced child abuse. Their research also found that most of the perpetrators of abuse are fathers, brothers, male relatives, followed by mothers and grandmothers in some cases.\n“Women were denied education, mobility, healthcare, and even nutrition. Decisions about their lives were taken without consent. Girls were burdened with care work and restricted in clothing, movement, and relationships,” the study found. They also came to the conclusion that violence is normalised, internalised, and transmitted across generations as discipline, family honour, and concern by the perpetrators.\nThe researchers said that cases of natal family violence were largely invisible in mainstream conversations on domestic violence which mostly talks about marital family violence and the community institutes fail to recognise this as a legitimate claim against violence.\n“Violence that women face in their natal families is huge. It starts even before birth through female foeticide and continues in many ways through discrimination, control, abuse, and forced marriages,” Anuradha Kapoor, the primary researcher of the study “The Natal Family: A Neglected Site of Domestic Violence Against Women” said during the launch of the study on July 17, Thursday.\nMs. Kapoor highlighted that each case of natal family violence is looked at as individual cases and the structural, cultural, and direct nature of the violence is largely ignored. She also said that many women who have sought help from Swayam in such cases have also refused to go public about the issue or even file cases against the abusers.\n“I was sent to my maternal grandparents’ house when I was one year old, three months before my brother was born, and lived there till I was 10. My grandfather would throw me on the ground and kick me. My grandmother would pinch me, bang my head against the wall frequently. My uncles beat me up and smashed my head against the wall when I was little. Eventually, my brother also began beating me up,” a survivor stated while recounting her experience of natal family violence.\nAfter their study, Swayam has recommended that there is a need to recognise natal family violence as a key dimension of domestic violence. “Strengthen laws and legal aid mechanisms, ensure access to property, education, and livelihood, train frontline workers and institutes to help support the survivors of abuse,” the researchers said. They also called for intersectional research on the subject across the nation to bring police level changes and help find survivor-centered solutions.\nPublished- July 20, 2025 12:08 am IST\nWest Bengal",

      "content": "For the second time in the past one year, Bangladesh has detained Indian fishermen, official sources said on Saturday (July 19, 2025). The development is being viewed by policymakers as a growing “absence of understanding” between the two sides against the backdrop of a seemingly uneasy relationship between Dhaka and New Delhi.\nThe latest incident took place during the intervening night of July 14 and 15 when 34 Indian fishermen in two trawlers — FB Jhor and FB Ma Mangal Chandi — were apprehended by Bangladesh authorities near the Mongla port.\n“As soon as information about the incident was received, our High Commission in Bangladesh took up the matter with Bangladeshi authorities through diplomatic channels seeking immediate consular access. We are constantly pursuing the matter for facilitating the safe and early return of all the fishermen along with their boats,” said an official dealing with the matter.\nOn October 8, 2009, Bangladesh initiated an arbitration to settle the maritime boundary dispute with India, and, in 2014, a settlement was reached through the Permanent Court of Arbitration. But though the maritime boundary was decided, lack of visible markers meant fishermen often strayed across the agreed line in the Bay of Bengal.\nIndia and Bangladesh arrested 185 fishermen in the winter of 2024 as bilateral ties plummeted following the overthrow of the Sheikh Hasina government on August 5, 2024. On January 5 this year, these individuals were exchanged when 95 Indian fishermen were handed over by Bangladesh authorities to the Indian Coast Guard. In response, India returned 90 Bangladeshi fishermen on the same day. As a matter of convention, both sides had an understanding that fishermen would have to be protected as they had no means to detect the invisible maritime boundary.\nSuch fishermen who crossed the boundary after the settlement of 2014 would often get detained but as part of an “unwritten understanding” supported by political leaders on both sides, these individuals would be quickly released as prolonged detention hurts economic prospects of fishermen in this region. However, the incidents of apprehension of fishermen are being interpreted by policymakers as a sign that the earlier “unwritten understanding” regarding fishermen is no longer being respected.\nThe Hinduwas told that Bangladesh is applying the law in a “stricter” manner which is leading to largescale and prolonged detention of Indian fishermen.\nPublished- July 19, 2025 10:14 pm IST\nIndia-Bangladesh/Bangladesh/arrest",

Out on bail, Rahul Gandhi has come forward to protect the ill-gotten assets amassed by his brother-in-law through corruption,” he alleged.\nThe BJP leader claimed that the Congress’s objective was that “even if they do not have political ground, they must possess the land of the farmers. Even if they lack political power, they must have the strength of money earned through corruption, and for that, they are willing to divide Indian society by region, language, or caste”.\n“Rahul Gandhi must clarify that if this was a family matter, then why is he making political allegations about it? Was the tweet made by Rahul Gandhi in his personal capacity, or was he misusing his position as Leader of the Opposition to defend his brother-in-law?” he asked.\nResponding to the Congress’s criticism of the government over the statement by U.S. President Donald Trump on the Pahalgam attack, Mr. Trivedi said: “The problem with the Congress is that they tend to see negativity in everything that is excellent. It is a result of India’s strong diplomatic capabilities that the United States has declared the Pahalgam attackers “TRF” as a terrorist organisation, and even China has today condemned the Pahalgam terror attack.”\nPublished- July 19, 2025 02:42 pm IST\nIndian National Congress/national politics/money laundering/crime",

      "content": "TheNational Investigation Agency (NIA) chargesheeteda senior leader of the banned Communist Party of India (Maoist) in connection with an anti-India conspiracy case.\nThe supplementary chargesheet was filed before the NIA Special Court in Hyderabad, naming C.P. Moideen alias Girish, under various provisions of the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, 1967, and the Indian Penal Code (IPC).\nAccording to the NIA, Moideen was actively involved in the Maoist conspiracy to wage war against the Government of India. Evidence gathered during the investigation confirmed his central role in Maoist operations within the Western Ghats Special Zonal Committee (WGSZC) of the CPI (Maoist).\nInvestigations also revealed that he functioned as a Special Zonal Committee Member and later assumed the post of Secretary of WGSZC following the arrest of Central Committee Member Sanjoy Deepak Rao in September 2023.\nMoideen oversaw People’s Liberation Guerrilla Army (PLGA) squads in the WGSZC region, led recruitment campaigns, spread Maoist ideology, and planned violent activities targeting security forces at the Kerala–Karnataka–Tamil Nadu tri-junction.\nMoideen was initially detained by Kerala Police in August 2024 and was formally arrested by the NIA in January 2025. The case was first registered by the Telangana Police in September 2023 following the arrest of Sanjoy Deepak Rao, who was caught carrying arms, ammunition, and Maoist literature.\nThe NIA subsequently took over the investigation, filing a chargesheet against Rao and pursuing a wider probe aimed at thwarting the CPI (Maoist)’s revival plans and dismantling its urban and armed networks.\nPublished- July 19, 2025 08:11 am IST\nnational security/terrorism (crime)/Telangana",

      "publication_date": "2025-07-18T18:57:43+05:30",
      "content": "TheSupreme Courton Friday (July 18, 2025) rejected an appeal filed by Yuvajana Sramika Rythu Congress Party (YSRCP) MP P.V. Midhun Reddy challenging theAndhra PradeshHigh Court’sdecision to deny him anticipatory bailin the liquor scam case.\nA Bench headed by Justice J.B. Pardiwala dismissed the special leave petition filed by Mr. Reddy, who was represented by senior advocates A.M. Singhvi and Mahfooz A. Nazki, after briefly hearing submissions by both sides.\nAlso read:Midhun Reddy is one of primary executors; played instrumental role in liquor scam: Andhra Pradesh CID\nMr. Singhvi argued that the High Court had erred in itsJuly 15 order, asserting that his client was no “fly-by-night operator” but a three-time Member of Parliament and a person of high repute.\nHe submitted that there was no justification for arresting Mr. Reddy, particularly when there were no substantive allegations against him and the case was entirely false.\n“The entire endeavour of the State is to harass the petitioner and to injure and humiliate him by having him arrested,” Mr. Reddy’s counsel argued.\nAppearing for the State, senior advocate Mukul Rohatgi contended that in May, the same Bench of the top court had refused anticipatory bail to K. Dhananjaya Reddy and P. Krishna Mohan Reddy, both of whom had served in former Chief Minister Jagan Mohan Reddy’s office during the previous YSRCP regime.\nThe court had at the time observed that pre-arrest bail would “come in the way of the investigating agency if it wanted their custodial interrogation.” Like Mr. Reddy, the two co-accused had claimed that the case was politically motivated and reflected bias on the part of the ruling Telugu Desam Party (TDP).\nIn the present plea, Mr. Reddy’s side narrated that the State had initially stated before the High Court that he had no role in the case and was not even named as an accused. However, the government later altered its stand, even deputing police teams to New Delhi to arrest the MP. The petition described the State’s change in position as “shocking” and “beyond comprehension”.\nThe plea further said that the “evidence” cited by the State involved a ₹5 crore transaction between PLR Projects Private Limited and M/s D-Cart Logistics.\n“It is contended by the State that the petitioner is connected to PLR Enterprises, and therefore, the money is directly traceable to him. The allegation is ex facie incorrect as the petitioner is neither a director nor a shareholder of the company. While it is correct that some of the family members of the petitioner are shareholders/directors of the company, the same, by itself, cannot implicate the petitioner,” the petition stated.\nThe arguments, however, did not find favour with the top court.\nPublished- July 18, 2025 06:57 pm IST\nIndia/Andhra Pradesh/Supreme Court",

      "content": "The Supreme Court on Friday (July 18, 2025) refused to intervene in aninterim orderof the Delhi High Court declining to stay a corruption trial against former Bihar Chief Minister Lalu Prasad in a land-for-jobs case.\nHowever, a Bench of Justices MM Sundresh and N. Kotiswar Singh asked the Delhi High Court to expedite the hearing in the main petition filed by Mr. Yadav to quash the criminal case registered against him by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI).\nThe Bench also made it clear observations made by the High Court in the interim order would not affect the disposal of the main petition.\nThe apex court said it did not want to comment on the case against Mr. Yadav on the basis of an appeal filed by him challenging an interim order of the High Court.\nThe court further dispensed with the presence of Mr. Yadav from the trial proceedings after considering his age and health.\nSenior advocate Kapil Sibal, appearing for Mr. Yadav, said the corruption case was related to Group D appointments made in the West Central Zone of the Indian Railways based in Jabalpur, Madhya Pradesh, during Mr. Yadav’s tenure as the Railway Minister between 2004 and 2009, allegedly in return for land parcels gifted or transferred by the recruits in the name of his family or associates.\nThe case was registered on May 18, 2022, against Mr. Yadav and others, including his wife, two daughters, unidentified public officials and private persons.\nMr. Sibal submitted that the FIR was lodged after a 14-year delay despite initial enquiries and investigations had led to the filing of a closure report in the competent court.\nHe questioned why the CBI had not taken prior sanction before prosecuting Mr. Yadav, whose actions as a Minister was under question.\n“The investigation cannot start without a prior sanction under Section 17A of the Prevention of Corruption Act. The agency had taken sanction for all the government servants, except him [Yadav]... The enthusiasm is telling,” Mr. Sibal said.\nAppearing for the CBI, Additional Solicitor General SV Raju countered that sanction was not required as the offence was allegedly committed prior to the 2018 amendment of the Act inserting Section 17A.\nMr. Sibal responded that the FIR however was registered in 2021, post the amendment.\nThe Bench said it did not want to look into the merits and facts of the case, which may be left to the High Court to consider.\nPublished- July 18, 2025 02:32 pm IST",

      "content": "Defending Robert Vadra, Leader of Opposition in the Lok Sabha, Rahul Gandhi said that hisbrother-in-law has been hounded by the Narendra Modi governmentover the last decade and that “truth shall prevail”\nHis comments come a day after the Enforcement Directorate (ED) filed a chargesheet against Congress MP Priyanka Gandhi Vadra’s husband, businessman Robert Vadra, in connection with amoney laundering case related to a 3.53-acre land deal in Shikohpurvillage in Gurugram, Haryana, in 2008.\nIn a post on X, Mr. Gandhi said, “My brother-in-law has been hounded by this government for the last ten years. This latest chargesheet is a continuation of that witch hunt.”\nExtending full support to Mr. Vadra, Mr. Gandhi wrote, “I stand with Robert, Priyanka and their children as they face yet another onslaught of malicious, politically motivated slander and harassment.”\nHe also commended their courage in facing the alleged persecution. “I know that they are all brave enough to withstand any kind of persecution and they will continue to do so with dignity. The truth will eventually prevail,” Mr. Gandhi added.\nMy brother-in-law has been hounded by this government for the last ten years. This latest chargesheet is a continuation of that witch hunt.I stand with Robert, Priyanka and their children as they face yet another onslaught of malicious, politically motivated slander and…\nOther party leaders also echoed Mr. Gandhi’s stance. In a statement, Congress general secretary (Organisation) K.C. Venugopal alleged that there is a direct correlation between the upcoming Assembly polls and action taken by central agencies. “As the election cycle draws close, the BJP government’s nervousness is once again on full display. True to its pattern, the Modi government has unleashed central agencies like the Enforcement Directorate in a desperate bid to intimidate the Opposition and divert attention away from its own failure,” he said.\nHe also added that the case against Mr. Vadra is an old one, with no new developments, and alleged that the chargesheet was timed to synchronise with the election schedule.\n“The Congress party sees this tactic of the government for what it is: A calculated strategy of the ruling party to malign Mr. Robert Vadra’s image through false accusations. This is not the first time the BJP has weaponised agencies to harass political opponents and this won’t be the last,” Mr. Venugopal added.\nFormer Rajasthan Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot said more than a decade has passed, with hundreds of hours of questioning, and several appearances before the ED, “repeated failed attempts to tarnish the family’s image, yet no conspiracy was proven, no evidence was found.” “Even after all this, nothing could be established against Mr. Vadra, so a chargesheet has been filed just to defame. This clearly exposes the malicious intent of the Modi government,” Mr. Gehlot said in a post on X.\nCongress Rajya Sabha MP and general secretary Randeep Surjewala termed the action “witch-hunting”. In a post on X, he said there  was “not an iota of illegality” in the land deal involving Mr. Vadra and asked, since when has the sale and purchase of property become illegal. “The witch hunting of Sh. Robert Vadra is another vicious attempt of the Modi government to intimidate and persecute, which will fail miserably,” Mr. Surjewala said.\nPublished- July 18, 2025 11:13 am IST\nnational politics/Rahul Gandhi",

Indicating India’s international campaign to further action against terror outfits based on Pakistani soil, the Ministry of External Affairs said that India’s cooperation with international partners will continue to ensure “that terrorist organizations and their proxies are held accountable”.\n“The TRF, a proxy of the Pakistan-based terrorist organization Lashkar-e-Tayyiba (LeT), has been involved in numerous terror-related activities, including theheinous attack on civilians in Pahalgam, Jammu and Kashmir, on April 22, 2025 for which it twice claimed responsibility,” said a statement issued by the Ministry of External Affairs in response to the U.S. designation of the TRF.\nEarlier, the U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio had announced the Trump administration’s decision to add the TRF to the list of Foreign Terrorist Organisation (FTO) and Specially Designated Global Terrorist outfits.

Security Counil passed a resolution 25 April that condemned the attack but stopped short of naming the TRF.After Operation Sindoorthat targeted terror bases in Pakistan, India sent a delegation to the United Nations campaigning for tough action against the TRF. Concerns on terrorism featured also in the July 2, 2025 Quad Foreign Ministers meeting held in Washington DC where a joint statement “strongly” condemned the Pahalgam attack.\n“India has consistently emphasized the need for global cooperation in the fight against terrorism and the dismantlinig of terror infrastructure. The designation of TRF is a timely and important step reflecting the deep cooperation between India and the United States on counter-terrorism,” said the MEA in appreciation of the designation of the TRF.\n“India remains committed to a policy of zero tolerance towards terrorism and will continue to work closely with its international partners to ensure that terrorist organizations and their proxies are held accountable,” said the MEA appreciating the support from U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio.\nPublished- July 18, 2025 09:46 am IST\nPahalgam terror attack 2025/USA/India/Mumbai terror attacks/Operation Sindoor 2025",
