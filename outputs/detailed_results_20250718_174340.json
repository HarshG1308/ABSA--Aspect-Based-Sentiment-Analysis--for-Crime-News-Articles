      "content": "PATNA: A local BJP leader has been shot dead by unidentified gunmen in Biharâs Sheikhpura village, a week after killing of businessman Gopal Khemka in Patna. The victim, Surendra Kewat, 52, was a former president of the BJP Kisan Morcha in Punpun. He was reportedly irrigating his field near the BihtaâSarmera State Highway-78 on Saturday night when he was attacked.

Sub-divisional police officer Kanhaiya Singh and Pipra police visited the scene following the incident. Patna SP (East) Parichay Kumar confirmed that no shell casings were recovered and that the victim was shot once. A post-mortem examination is underway and police said an FIR will be registered after receiving a complaint from the family. A investigation has also been launched. Local MLA Gopal Ravidas met the victimâs family at AIIMS and assured them that those responsible would be brought to justice. He also raised concerns about rising crime in the region. Opposition leader Tejashwi Yadav criticised the state government in a post on social media platform X, saying, âAnd now, a BJP leader shot dead in Patna! What to say, and to whom? Is there anyone in the NDA government willing to listen to the truth or admit their mistakes?â He also questioned the role of the state's deputy chief ministers, saying: âEveryone knows about the CM's health, but what are the two useless BJP deputy chief ministers doing?âGopal Khemka murderBusinessman Gopal Khemka was shot dead near Gandhi Maidan in Patna, Bihar, at around 11.00pm on 4 July.Police said one bullet and its shell were recovered from the scene.

      "content": "Indonesiaâs National Narcotics Agency (BNN) has identified Bali as a key location for drug trafficking operations, involving Russian and Ukrainian nationals. According to Indonesia's state-run Antara news agency, these syndicates are using advanced technologies like blockchain to avoid detection by law enforcement.BNN chief, police commissioner general Marthinus Hukom, said his agency has found that traffickers are relying on distributed ledger systems to manage their operations discreetly. \"This is a very unique phenomenon, where nationals of Russia and Ukraine â two countries currently at war â have become partners in the crime (of) drug trafficking in Bali,\" Hukom said during a public lecture at Udayana University in Bali, as quoted by Antara.Hukom noted that traffickers are using social media platforms, particularly Instagram, to connect with buyers.Communication is carried out using coded language and encryption to prevent tracing. The syndicates are also conducting transactions through cryptocurrencies rather than traditional payment methods, making enforcement efforts more complex. \"It is very difficult to crack down on such practices because the perpetrators do not make transactions in a conventional manner,\" Hukom was quoted as saying by news agency Ankara.Indonesian authorities are coordinating with Russian officials to address the issue.The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime has previously said that Indonesia is a major target for international drug syndicates, partly due to its large youth population, even though the country has strict drug laws.",

      "content": "From Odisha to Karnataka, Bengal to Delhi, violence against women has seen an ominous rise over the past few months. What is even more appalling is that crimes are being committed in spaces such as school and college campuses or workplaces which are usually presumed to be safe havens. On July 14,a 20-year-old student of Fakir Mohan Autonomous College, Balasore, passed awayafter suffering 90% burns in an immolation bid. The B.Ed student had taken the extreme step outside the principal’s office after her repeated complaints of sexual harassment, against a senior teacher, went unheard. The accused teacher, Samir Sahu, and the principal, Dillip Ghosh, have been arrested, but a precious life would not have been lost had her grievances been redressed in time. She ran from pillar to post, taking it right up to the Chief Minister’s office, but no one paid attention to her grave complaint. In Bengal, even before a year has passed sincea post-graduate student’s brutal killing at R.G. Kar Medical Hospital in 2024, a law college student was gang-raped on campus this June; in Mangaluru, two lecturers have been arrested for the alleged rape of a student; in Delhi, a nine-year-old girl’s rape and murder led to the Opposition crying foul over the collapse of law and order.\nLittle seems to have changed on the ground after Nirbhaya’s rape and murder in Delhi in 2012. Stringent laws are in place, but to what effect? The Odisha student’s plight has put the spotlight on Internal Complaint Committees, mandatory under the Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace Act, 2013. The Odisha government asked all colleges to form the committees within 24 hours, after the tragic death. Questions should be raised about the manner in which the system failed the student, and the absolute lack of accountability. The annual ‘Crime in India’ report by the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) for the year 2023 is yet to be released. Figures available for 2022 show that a total of 4,45,256 cases of ‘crimes against women’ were registered, showing an increase of 4% over 2021. While the majority of crimes against women were registered under ‘cruelty by husband or his relatives’ (31.4%), ‘assault on women with intent to outrage her modesty’ comprised 18.7% of all crimes, and ‘rape’ was pegged at 7.1%. It must be noted that many crimes go unreported as well. In this backdrop, conversations about sexual violence and gender are imperative, and must start early. The clamour for justice against a crime should not die down after a few days either, especially when protectors turn predators.\nPublished- July 17, 2025 12:10 am IST\ncrime, law and justice/gender/school/universities and colleges/Orissa/Karnataka/West Bengal/Delhi/Mangalore/sexual assault & rape",

When officers arrived, they found her physically assaulting her sister’s daughter. A female police officer who tried to stop the attack was pushed to the ground by Rasina.\nPrior to the police’s arrival, Rasina reportedly forced her way into the residence and demanded money from her mother. As this was refused, she allegedly went on a rampage, damaging household property, breaking windows and smashing the windshield of a car parked in the courtyard.\nPolice sources confirmed that Rasina has a history of criminal charges.\nThe current charges against her include assault, obstruction of duty of a public servant and destruction of property.\nPublished- June 20, 2025 01:10 pm IST\nKerala/Kannur/crime",

Unable to bear it, the victim filed a complaint twice - once with Basavanagudi police, and another with Cottonpete police. The police summoned the accused for questioning, but let him go after recording a statement and an undertaking.\nHowever, the accused allegedly continued to harass her. On Friday, while the victim went to the washroom at her office, Pasha reportedly followed her and dragged her to the terrace. He proceeded to propose her for marriage again, and was aggressive in his behaviour. The victim tried to escape, but the accused then allegedly molested her. Amidst the melee, the victim fell on the ground and the accused threatened to throw her down from the terrace if she did not agree to his proposal, as per the complaint.\nThe victim was then able to raise an alarm for help, following which two other colleagues rushed to the scene and rescued her. Sensing trouble, the accused managed to escape. She was later taken to Victoria hospital for treatment.\n.\nPublished- June 20, 2025 12:44 am IST\nKarnataka/Bangalore/crime",
